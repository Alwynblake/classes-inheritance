# classes-inheritance
* Migrating working code into a new methodology or tech stack. 
* This app demonstrates a migrated standard constructor function exported from a node module into a Class, maintaining the same

=====================
Implement both Car and Motorcycle using a Javascript Class (in the vehicle-class.js file)
The tests are pre-configured to run only the constructor variety, but will need to be altered to also test your Classes
Try and find a way to keep this DRY
